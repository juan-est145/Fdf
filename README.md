A repository containing the fdf project of 42 Malaga. The aim of this project is to parse the files included in tests maps so that the program can read them and create a isometric projection of those coordinates, thus creating 3D looking images.

For example, passing the pikachu.fdf file as an argument to the program will create the following image.

This project is only supposed to work on MacOS. In order to compile it first make sure that you have installed the neccesary dependencies needed for the graphical library to work. You can find them here:
(https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42).

Once that you have installed the dependencies, just go to the root of the project and execute make in the terminal. After that execute the program and provide the path to the map that you wish to print as a argument.

If you are a fellow student at 42, DO NOT COPY ANYTHING FROM THIS REPOSITORY THAT YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND, use it to learn instead.
